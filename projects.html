      <h3>Controller Area Network development using ARM Cortex M3 based microcontroller</h3>
      <h5>Modelling and design of a CAN Network using mbed LPC1768 and MCP2551</h5>
      <h5><i>April 2020 - May 2020 </i></h5>
      <p class="pro-desc">
        This is a simple demonstration of CAN network development using ARM Cortex M3 based microcontroller and CAN transceivers. I have used mbed LPC1768 boards along with MCP2551 CAN transceivers as the transmitter and receiver ECUs.
        Programming is done using the mbed online compiler. This project can be considered as a starter in CAN network development and automotive domain.

      <h3>Road Lane Detection</h3>
      <h5>Real-Time Lane Detection and Steering Angle Calculation (For Autonomous Cars) </h5>
      <h5><i>University of Washington, WA, USA </i></h5>
      <h5><i>Jan 2017 - Mar 2017 </i></h5>
      <p class="pro-desc">
        This project illustrates one of the autonomous features used in self-driving cars, Lane Detection. This project consists of two systems in which System I deals with the detection of road lane lines in real time and System II deals with the
        calculation of steering angle (angle of the lane lines with the horizontal) accordingly. Implementation was done using Raspberry Pi (Model 3) and Raspberry Pi Camera (Version 2.1) coded in OpenCV-Python and OpenCV-C++.

      <h3>Glaucoma Detection</h3>
      <h5>Computer based detection of Glaucoma from retinal fundus images using CDR calculation </h5>
      <h5><i>University of Washington, WA, USA </i></h5>
      <h5><i>Apr 2017 - June 2017</i></h5>
      <p class="pro-desc">
        Glaucoma, caused by the increased intraocular pressure (IOP) of the eye, is one of the many eye diseases that can lead to ocular damage and vision loss if not detected and treated in proper time. In this proposed study, an automated system is
        developed for glaucoma detection by optic disc and optic cup segmentation and CDR (Cup-to-Disc Ratio) calculation. CDR is calculated in two ways and they are named as Area based CDR (ACDR) and Diameter based CDR (DCDR) in this study. Risk
        analysis is done using the standard CDR value range. High-Resolution Fundus (HRF) Image Database, which contains a total of 40 images, is used for testing the proposed algorithm. Performance evaluation is done by the calculation of
        sensitivity and specificity metrics.

      <h3>CAN BUS Network using Arduino and CAN BUS Shield</h3>
      <h5>Modelling and design of a CAN Network using Arduino and CAN BUS Shield</h5>
      <h5><i>April 2018 - May 2018 </i></h5>
      <p class="pro-desc">
        This project is a demonstration of a simple CAN BUS network using Arduino and CAN BUS Shield. Two CAN BUS Shields are connected on top of an Arduino Uno and an Arduino Mega respectively.
        CAN messages are sent from one end to control the circuit or display the values on the other end. An LED and potentiometer are connected to Arduino UNO and a push button is connected to Arduino Mega.
        The push button (on Mega) controls the LED (on Uno) and the value of the potentiometer (on UNO) can be displayed on the serial monitor (on Mega) of the Arduino Mega. This simple circuit is a beginner level project on CAN BUS communication.

      <h3>PCA based facial recognition</h3>
      <h5>Discussion on Multivariate Gaussian Distribution and Facial Image Reconstruction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) </h5>
      <h5><i>University of Washington, WA, USA </i></h5>
      <h5><i>Sept 2016 - Dec 2016 </i></h5>
      <p class="pro-desc">
        This project dealt with the reconstruction of a data set of Facial images from the data base provided by AT&T called 'The Database of Faces'. Implementation was done in MATLAB by applying principle component analysis (PCA). A test face image
        is reconstructed by projecting eigen-faces onto it to see minimum required number of principal components, so that the reconstructed image is identifiable. Main application is to conserve storage space. A brief discussion and experimentation
        on multivariate gaussian distribution was done as part of this project.
